# Introduction 

Contains a pygame project for creating a solar system simulation. Intended to be used as a coding lesson and divided into different directories with different levels of 'completed' code.

## boilerplate

The lowest level of completed code. Contains some basic boilerplate code and pseudo-code comments that need to be replaced.

## basic

The basic implementation of the simulation. This code is ready-to-run with a very simple display of an 'Earth' body orbiting a 'Sun' body.

# Requirements

## dev container

When running this code in a vs code dev container, an x-server application running on the host machine, such as https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/
